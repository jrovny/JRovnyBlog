# JRovny Blog

Ths is the main repository for [JRovny Blog](https://www.jrovny.com). JRovny Blog is a software development blog primarily targeted towards intermediate to advanced members of the software and web development community.

## Project

This site was built using a blend of different technologies. For the frontend we are using the popular SPA framework Angular, and for the backend we are using ASP.NET Core. The page has been styled with theming from [Google Material](https://material.io/design), specifically [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/).

## Roadmap

We plan to add authentication to the site to allow users to upvote and downvote blog posts and comments, as well as subscribe for updates. We also plan to add a dark theme.
